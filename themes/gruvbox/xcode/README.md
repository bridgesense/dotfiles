# Gruvbox Theme for Xcode!

An Xcode theme that colour-matches the wonderful gruvbox theme for vim! [The gruvbox vim repo](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) describes its theme as: 

> Designed as a bright theme with pastel 'retro groove' colors and light/dark mode switching in the way of solarized. The main focus when developing gruvbox is to keep colors easily distinguishable, contrast enough and still pleasant for the eyes.

## Installation
1. Download the [.zip file](https://github.com/jstheoriginal/gruvbox-theme-for-xcode/archive/master.zip) from this repo.
1. Close Xcode.
1. Open Finder then from the menu bar choose `Go` -> `Go to folder...`.
1. Paste `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes/` into the pop-up to open your Xcode themes folder. If this folder does not yet exist, you will need to create it first.
1. Copy the unzipped `Gruvbox.dvtcolortheme` file into the folder.
1. Open Xcode and go to Xcode > `Preferences...`
1. Under `Fonts & Colors`, choose `Gruvbox` from the list and apply it.
1. Enjoy!

_**Note:** The theme is set to use SF Mono (San Francisco Mono). The font used in the screenshot is [DejaVu Sans Mono for Powerline](https://github.com/powerline/fonts/tree/master/DejaVuSansMono) if you want to use it._

Notes:
---
This dotfile repo is loosely based on YADR which is a really solid dotfile package.
Some of the commands and look are directly borrowed from Yan Pritzker's work albeit
this is much more simplified. The changes are intentional in order to speed things up
a bit while giving emphasis to PHP development instead.  This package is also
designed to be uploaded to remote workstations without breaking anything due to
any lack of installed packages onboard.


Installation:
---
#### sh -c "\`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bridgesense/dotfiles/master/setup`"

#### bash ~/.dotsense/setup update

#### bash ~/.dotsense/setup remove

# YADRLite #


Credit:

This dotfile repo is heavily based on [YADR] (https://github.com/skwp/dotfiles) which is a really solid dotfile package created by Yan Pritzker and worked on by several others.  This is not intended to be a fork of YADR.  At the same time, I take no credit here either.  This is just a personal collection of YADR's tools trimmed down considerably for the sake of speed and portability.  

Check out the original repo, [YADR by Yan] (https://github.com/skwp/dotfiles) especially if you work in Python or Ruby.



Installation:
---
#### sh -c "\`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bridgesense/dotfiles/master/setup`"

#### bash ~/.yadrlite/setup update

#### bash ~/.yadrlite/setup remove



What's Included:
---
Shortcuts have been pulled over from YADR, so those working with YADR should feel right at home.  There are a few minor changes and additions.  A LOT may be missing.  This package will be gearing towards PHP development on local staging environments and setting up shop on web servers for emergencies where there there is limited permissions.

As with YADR, most of the key mapping can be found in the settings directory for reference.  More information may come later offering examples on how to use this with [xDebug] (https://github.com/bridgesense/Quick-Scotchbox-Install#vim--vdebug-settings-) and a few other tools.  This package is ready for deployment on MacOS, but there more cleanup to do for Linux.  There are no plans for Windows deployment.

Notes:
---
This dotfile repo is based on YADR which is a really solid dotfile package.
Some of the commands and look are directly borrowed from Yan Pritzker's work albeit
this is much more simplified. The changes are intentional in order to speed things up
a bit while giving emphasis to PHP development.

#### sh -c "\`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bridgesense/dotfiles/master/setup`"

#### bash ~/.dotsense/setup update

#### bash ~/.dotsense/setup remove

Check out the original repo, [YADR by Yan] (https://github.com/skwp/dotfiles) especially if you work in Python or Ruby.

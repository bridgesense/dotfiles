Notes:
---
This dotfile repo is based on YADR which is a really solid dotfile package.
Some of the commands and look are directly borrowed from Yan's work albeit
many elements are missing here. This was intentional in order to streamline
speed while giving emphasis to PHP development.

#### sh -c "\`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bridgesense/dotfiles/master/setup`"
